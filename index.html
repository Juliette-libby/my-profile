		<h1>Hello, I'm Juliette </h1>
		<img src="images/profile3.png" alt="Juliette Libby">
		<p> 	I'm a Franco-American first year student at IESEG in the PGE program. I really enjoy playing the piano and sports, and I'm a habit world traveller. Being very curious about exploring new places, I fell in love with the lonelyplanet website as it shares story-worthy travel moments and breath-taking pictures from all over the world.

	<h2>Pianoüéº</h2>
	<p> 
  	I have been playing the piano since I was 4. I practiced the solf√®ge for 2 years and then learned a significant number of pieces such as: Hit the road Jack, The winner takes it all, Titanium, Hallelujah, and many others. My favorite composer is Ludovic Einaudi, with my all time favorite piece of his called "Fly".

	<h2>Sportsüí™üèº</h2>
	<p> 
 	 Sport have played a big part of my life, including: Track & Field, rythmic gymnastics (in which I came 3rd place in the France Championships at the age of 10), volleyball, swimming, ski/snowboard, horseback riding, crossfit, and many more. Currently, I go to the gym 3 times a week to stay in shape (although I also use it as an excuse to take a break from studying).

	<h2>Travelüåé</h2>
	<p> 
 	Having grown up in a multicultural country (Luxembourg), I was lucky to have friends coming from many places that helped me learn their cultures. Some of my all favorite destinations are: Zanzibar (Tanzania), San Francisco (USA) and the Dolomites (Italy). One place I have never been to but want to visit one day is Tokyo (Japan).
